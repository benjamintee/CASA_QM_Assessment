<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="englands-energy-crisis-is-no-longer-about-volatility---its-about-persistence-and-inequality.">England’s energy crisis is no longer about volatility - it’s about persistence and inequality.</h2>
<p><em>Date: 12 Jan 2026</em></p>
<p>While headline energy prices have eased since 2022, household energy bills in England remain above pre-crisis levels. What has emerged is not a short-lived shock, but a sustained financial burden. When high energy costs persist, they begin to shape household finances and regional inequalities. Understanding who is most exposed, and why, is central to designing effective energy policy.</p>
<section id="from-shock-to-persistence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-shock-to-persistence">From shock to persistence</h3>
<p>The sharp rise in energy cost in 2022 was driven by global wholesale gas prices and exacerbated by geopolitical shocks<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Since then, wholesale prices have moderated. The government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) temporarily also capped household exposure at the height of the crisis<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Yet, this has not returned household bills to pre-2021 norms. Latest estimates show that the energy price cap remains around £600 (45%) higher than before the crisis (<u>Figure 1</u>). Moreover, the cap is projected to rise again in the coming quarters<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. While volatility has eased, prices have settled at historically high levels.</p>

<p>This persistence places growing pressure on households. Average levels of energy debt and the number of households in arrears have risen sharply since 2021 (<u>Figure 2</u>), suggesting that many have been unable to absorb higher costs through behavioural adjustments or savings alone <span class="citation" data-cites="ofgem_debt_2025">(<a href="#ref-ofgem_debt_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Ofgem, 2025a</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>While the impact is most acute for lower-income households, higher energy costs are also squeezing the broad-middle. At least 15% of middle-income households now report struggling to heat their homes adequately <span class="citation" data-cites="cook_2025">(<a href="#ref-cook_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Tilly Cook, 2025</a>)</span>. It is therefore unsurprising that energy costs remain at the top of public concerns. A March 2025 IPSOS UK survey<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> found that close to nine in ten respondents (88%) were worried about the price households pay for energy — a figure unchanged since the height of the crisis (<u>Figure 3</u>).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exposure-to-high-energy-costs-is-uneven-across-england">Exposure to high energy costs is uneven across England</h3>
<p>Although household energy prices are nationally regulated, the costs households face are far from uniform. Average bills depend not only on prices, but on how much energy households consume and how efficiently their homes convert energy into power.</p>
<p>As a result, some households face persistently high energy costs because they live in larger, older or less efficient homes, rely on more expensive heating systems, or have limited scope to reduce consumption. These differences reflect structural characteristics of housing rather than short-term behavioural choices alone.</p>
<p><u>Figure 4</u> illustrates this uneven exposure by mapping average household energy costs across England. Higher costs are concentrated across much of the North and Midlands, and parts of the South Coast, while lower average costs are more common in parts of the Southwest and East. There is also substantial variation within regions and cities.</p>
<p>This raises a key question: <strong>if prices are broadly similar, why does its impact differ so sharply, and what does that imply for equitable energy policy?</strong></p>

<section id="what-drives-differences-in-household-energy-costs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-drives-differences-in-household-energy-costs">What drives differences in household energy costs?</h3>
<p>To explore these drivers, we estimate a multivariate model that relates average household energy costs to building age and energy efficiency, dwelling characteristics, household composition and heating infrastructure, while controlling for regional differences. We aim to identify structural factors that are most strongly associated with high energy costs.</p>
<p>Results are summarised in <u>Table 1</u>. Three findings stand out.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Housing energy inefficiency is a central driver of high costs</strong>. Areas with a higher share of energy-inefficient homes (EPC bands D-G), face significantly higher annual energy costs, even after accounting for income and other housing characteristics. Poor insulation and inefficient heating systems amplify the associated increase of high prices, meaning that households in these homes pay more regardless of their income position.</li>
<li><strong>Housing form and household composition matter</strong>. Older and larger dwellings, detached housing and areas with more large households all face higher energy costs, reflecting greater baseline energy needs. These factors help explain why some higher-income areas still experience high absolute cost: higher incomes often coincide with larger, more energy-intensive homes.</li>
<li><strong>Income shapes households’ capacity to absorb energy costs rather than costs alone</strong>. Higher incomes are associated with higher energy consumption and higher costs, but they also provide greater financial resilience. In contrast, areas characterised by lower incomes have far less scope to accommodate rising costs, particularly where poor housing efficiency or heating systems push cost upwards.</li>

<p><em>Note: Effects are indicative averages and reflect associations rather than causal impact</em>.</p>
<p>These findings explain why financial pressure may extend beyond the lowest-income groups. A substantial share of middle-income households report struggling with energy bills not solely because they consume unusually large amounts of energy, but because structural features expose them to persistently high costs. In equity terms, households with similar incomes can face different energy pressures depending on where and how they live.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-place-still-matters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-place-still-matters">Why place still matters</h3>
<p>Even after accounting for income, housing characteristics and heating systems, some spatial variation in energy costs remains. This variation persists after controlling for regional differences, indicating finer localised differences such as housing stock composition, settlement patterns that shape how households experience energy prices.</p>
<p>Using a geographically weighted regression, <u>Figure 5</u> shows how the influence of income and energy efficiency vary across England. In some areas, higher incomes are closely associated with higher energy costs, reflecting consumption linked to larger or more energy-intensive homes. In others, income plays a much weaker role. In contrast, the cost penalty associated with poor housing efficiency is uneven, with inefficient homes driving higher cost in some places but less so in others.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="towards-equitable-policy-from-relief-to-resilience">Towards Equitable Policy: From Relief to Resilience</h3>
<p>These findings spur the following policy considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Moving Beyond Blunt Instruments:</strong> While universal subsidies are politically expedient and provide immediate relief, they are blunt instruments that fail to address structural drivers. These measures treat symptoms, often subsidizing consumption for those who do not need it while failing to provide deep support for those in the most inefficient homes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency as Long-Term Protection:</strong> Sustained investment in housing energy efficiency, such as insulation and heating upgrades, remains the most effective long-term defense against structurally high prices. This is especially critical in areas where poor housing stock imposes “efficiency penalties” on residents regardless of their income.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emphasis on Place-Based Targeting:</strong> The spatial heterogeneity identified in this study suggests that national income thresholds alone are insufficient. To ensure support reaches those most exposed, policy must become “place-sensitive,” accounting for local housing conditions and structural vulnerabilities that income data alone might overlook.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As energy prices settle at a higher level, the challenge for policymakers is no longer how to smooth volatility, but how to prevent nationally regulated prices from deepening inequality, and to shape an energy system that is both efficient and equitable.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="study-objective">1. Study Objective</h3>
<p>This study examines the structural drivers of domestic energy costs (electricity and gas) at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level in England. First, it identifies how housing characteristics, household composition, and heating systems are associated with variation in average annual household energy costs. Second, it assesses whether these relationships exhibit spatial dependence, indicating that some areas are systematically exposed to higher energy costs even after observable characteristics are controlled for.</p>
<p>The analysis is descriptive and explanatory rather than causal. By focusing on small-area averages, it highlights how nationally regulated energy prices translate into uneven local cost pressures through differences in housing stock, energy efficiency and household structure. The emphasis is on identifying structural sources of exposure and inequity, rather than estimating behavioural responses or causal treatment effects.</p>

<p>We assume that energy prices are nationally regulated and spatially uniform, reflecting Ofgem price caps. Spatial variation in observed energy costs therefore arises from differences in consumption, housing efficiency and heating systems rather than local price-setting.</p>

<p>Exploratory analysis (<u>Figure A1</u>) highlights substantial right-skewness in electricity costs and total energy costs, driven by a subset of MSOAs with high electricity reliance and larger dwellings. As household income is also right-skewed, log-transformation is applied. Heating system variables are unevenly distributed across space but are retained, as they represent structurally distinct energy systems with implications for electricity demand and exposure to high prices.</p>

<p>The preferred specification is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{EnergyCost}_i
= {} &amp; \alpha
+ \beta_1 \,\text{Pre1945}_i
+ \beta_2 \,\text{EPC}_{D\text{--}G,i}
+ \beta_3 \log(\text{FloorArea}_i) \\
&amp; + \beta_4 \log(\text{Income}_i)
+ \beta_5 \,\text{Detached}_i
+ \beta_6 \,\text{HH}_{4+,i} \\
&amp; + \beta_7 \,\text{FuelMix}_i
+ \beta_8 \,\text{Urban}_i
+ \gamma_r
+ \varepsilon_i
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>i</em> indexes MSOAs and γᵣ denotes region fixed effects.</p>
<p>Variables capture four structural dimensions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Housing age and efficiency</strong> (share pre-1945, share EPC D–G)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Housing scale and form</strong> (log floor area, share detached)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Household composition and income</strong> (log income, share 4+ households)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heating infrastructure</strong> (fuel mix indicators)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Multicollinearity is assessed using variance inflation factors and remains within accepted thresholds.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="regression-findings">4. Regression Findings</h3>
<p>Across all specifications, <strong>structural housing characteristics and household composition</strong> emerge as the primary drivers of variation in annual household energy costs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A higher share of <strong>energy-inefficient dwellings (EPC D–G)</strong> and <strong>pre-1945 housing</strong> is consistently associated with higher energy costs, even after controlling for income and dwelling size. These effects remain stable across all model specifications, indicating that housing efficiency and age exert an independent influence on energy expenditure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dwelling size and housing type</strong> are also strongly associated with energy costs. Larger median floor areas and a higher share of detached housing are linked to higher expenditure, reflecting greater baseline energy demand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Household composition</strong> also plays an important role. MSOAs with a higher share of households containing four or more persons exhibit substantially higher energy costs across all models, with this variable showing the largest coefficients throughout.</p></li>
<li><p>The inclusion of <strong>fuel mix variables</strong> materially improves explanatory power, with the adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> increasing from <span class="math inline">\(0.572\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.713\)</span>. Electric-only heating is associated with significantly higher energy costs, while solid and liquid fuels and renewables are associated with lower average expenditure.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding <strong>region fixed effects</strong> further improves model fit (final adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(0.745\)</span>), likely capturing residual climatic variation and regional housing patterns, without materially altering the main coefficient estimates.</p></li>

<p>Residual diagnostics (<u>Figure A3)</u> indicate satisfactory linearity and variance homogeneity, with mild right-skewness. Checks reveal a small number of high-cost MSOAs that tend to have larger dwellings and higher reliance on electricity.</p>

<p>Additional findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Income-Driven Areas</strong>: Higher energy costs align with income, suggesting consumption-led demand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency-Driven Areas</strong>: High EPC D–G coefficients indicate that poor housing quality drives costs regardless of household wealth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While GWR reached an <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of 0.88, the elevated fit likely reflects GWR’s inherent local overfitting and results serve an exploratory purpose rather than a formal refutation of the global model’s performance.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-and-limitations">6. Reflections and Limitations</h3>
<p>This analysis is subject to several limitations. As an ecological study, it cannot capture within-area household heterogeneity or behavioural responses such as under-heating. Data accuracy is also constrained by availability of EPC submissions which tend to be more sparse in rural areas, and retrofit history is not directly observed. Residual spatial clustering reflects genuine structural heterogeneity rather than model failure.</p>
<p>From an equity perspective, the results underline that exposure to high energy costs is shaped by place-specific housing conditions, not income alone. This reinforces the need for policy approaches that integrate housing efficiency and local context alongside income-based support.</p>
