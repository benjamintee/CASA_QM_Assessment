What has emerged is not a short-lived shock, but a sustained financial strain. When high energy costs persist, they begin to shape household finances and regional inequalities. Understanding who is most exposed, and why, is central to designing effective energy policy that goes beyond short-term subsidies.\n\n### From shock to persistence\n\nThe sharp rise in energy cost in 2022 was driven by global wholesale gas prices and exacerbated by geopolitical shocks[^1]. Since then, wholesale prices have moderated, and the government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) temporarily capped household exposure at the height of the crisis[^2].\n\n[^1]: Russia-Ukraine War (<https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9714/>)\n\n[^2]: In Sep 22, then-Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss announced the implementation of an Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) which meant that a typical UK household would pay up to £2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years. <https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-announces-energy-price-guarantee-for-families-and-businesses-while-urgently-taking-action-to-reform-broken-energy-market>\n\nYet, this has not returned household costs to pre-2021 norms. Latest estimates show that the energy price cap remains around £600 (45%) higher than before the crisis ([Figure 1]{.underline}). Moreover, the cap is projected to rise again in the coming quarters[^3]. While volatility has eased, prices have settled at historically high levels.\n\n[^3]: Cornwall insights forecasts that the price cap for energy bills is expected to rise by 3.2% in 2Q26, to take into account increases in network costs for electricity. <https://www.cornwall-insight.com/press-and-media/press-release/bills-remain-stable-but-new-forecast-signals-increases-in-april/>\n\n\n\n::: {#dd4fefc3 .cell execution_count=21}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Energy_Cost_files/figure-html/cell-22-output-1.png){width=787 height=526}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis persistence places growing pressure on households. Average levels of energy debt and the number of households in arrears have risen sharply since 2021 ([Figure 2]{.underline}), suggesting that many have been unable to absorb higher costs through behavioural adjustments or savings alone.\n\n::: {#99bb1ab0 .cell execution_count=22}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Energy_Cost_files/figure-html/cell-23-output-1.png){width=765 height=493}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhile the impact is most acute for lower-income households, higher energy costs are also squeezing the broad-middle. At least 15% of middle-income households now report struggling to heat their homes adequately[^4]. It is therefore unsurprising that energy costs remain at the top of public concerns. A March 2025 IPSOS UK survey[^5] found that close to nine in ten respondents (88%) were worried about the price households pay for home energy — a figure unchanged since the height of the crisis ([Figure 3]{.underline}).\n\n[^4]: Analysis by Joseph Rowntree Foundation using data from Family Resources Survey 2023/2024, Department for Work and Pensions. <https://www.jrf.org.uk/cost-of-living/energy-affordability-how-to-reduce-bills-for-majority-of-households>\n\n[^5]: <https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/almost-nine-ten-britons-are-concerned-about-energy-prices>\n\n::: {#3728ab3e .cell execution_count=23}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Energy_Cost_files/figure-html/cell-24-output-1.png){width=775 height=502}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exposure to high energy costs is uneven across England\n\nAlthough household energy prices are nationally regulated, the costs households face are far from uniform leading to unequal outcomes. Average bills depend not only on prices, but on how much energy households consume and how efficiently their homes convert energy into power.\n\nAs a result, some households face persistently high energy costs because they live in larger, older or less efficient homes, rely on more expensive heating systems, or have limited scope to reduce consumption. These differences reflect structural characteristics of housing rather than short-term behavioural choices alone.\n\n[Figure 4]{.underline} illustrates this uneven exposure by mapping average household energy costs across England. Higher costs are concentrated across much of the North and Midlands, and parts of the South Coast, while lower average costs are more common in parts of the Southwest and East. There is also substantial variation within regions and cities.\n\nThis raises a key question: **if prices are broadly similar, why does its impact differ so sharply, and what does that imply for equitable energy policy?**\n\n::: {#90cccdfe .cell execution_count=24}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Energy_Cost_files/figure-html/cell-25-output-1.png){width=796 height=860}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### What drives differences in household energy costs?\n\nTo explore these drivers, we estimate a multivariate model that relates average household energy costs to building age and energy efficiency, dwelling characteristics, household composition and heating infrastructure, while controlling for regional differences. We aim to identify which structural factors are most strongly associated with persistently high energy costs.\n\nResults are summarised in [Table 1]{.underline}. Three findings stand out.\n\n1.  **Housing energy inefficiency is a central driver of high costs**. Areas with a higher share of energy-inefficient homes (EPC bands D-G), face significantly higher annual energy costs, even after accounting for income and other housing characteristics. Poor insulation and inefficient heating systems amplify the associated increase of high prices, meaning that households in these homes pay more regardless of their income position. Housing inefficiency does not merely coincide with low incomes; it actively magnifies exposure to high energy prices.\n2.  **Housing form and household composition matter**. Older and larger dwellings, detached housing and areas with more large households all face higher energy costs, reflecting greater baseline energy needs. These factors help explain why some higher-income areas still experience high absolute cost: higher incomes often coincide with larger, more energy-intensive homes.\n3.  **Income shapes households’ capacity to absorb energy costs rather than costs alone**. Higher incomes are associated with higher energy consumption and higher costs, but they also provide greater financial resilience. In contrast, areas characterised by lower incomes have far less scope to accommodate rising costs, particularly where poor housing efficiency or heating systems push cost upwards.\n\n| Structural factor (MSOA-level) | Modelled change in annual energy cost (per HH) |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| +10pp share of households with 4+ people | ≈ +£170 |\n| +10% increase in median floor area of homes | ≈ +£65-75 |\n| +10pp share of EPC D–G homes | ≈ +£50–65 |\n| +10pp share of detached homes | ≈+£50-60 |\n| +10% increase in household income | ≈+£50-55 |\n| +10pp share of pre-1945 housing | ≈+£15-20 |\n\n*Note: Estimates are based on the preferred OLS specification controlling for housing characteristics, heating mix, urban–rural status and region. Effects are indicative averages and reflect associations rather than causal impact*.\n\nThese findings explain why financial pressure extends beyond the lowest-income groups. A substantial share of middle-income households report struggling with energy bills not solely because they consume unusually large amounts of energy, but because structural features expose them to persistently high costs. In equity terms, households with similar incomes can face different energy pressures depending on where and how they live.\n\n### Why place still matters\n\nEven after accounting for income, housing characteristics and heating systems, some spatial variation in energy costs remains. This reflects localised differences in heating infrastructure, housing stock composition and settlement patterns that shape how households experience nationally regulated energy prices.\n\n[Figure 5]{.underline} shows how the influence of income and energy efficiency vary across England. In some areas, higher incomes are closely associated with higher energy costs, reflecting consumption linked to larger or more energy-intensive homes. In others, income plays a much weaker role. In contrast, the cost penalty associated with poor housing efficiency is uneven, with inefficient homes driving higher cost in some places but less so in others.\n\n\n\n::: {#32a6a725 .cell execution_count=26}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Energy_Cost_files/figure-html/cell-27-output-1.png){width=772 height=598}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Towards more equitable policy outcomes\n\nWhat does this mean for policy?\n\n1.  Blanket price suppression and universal subsidies are blunt instruments. While they reduce short-term hardship and are politically expedient, they may not address the structural reasons why some households face higher costs than others.\n\n2.  Sustained investment in housing energy efficiency offers an effective long-term responses to high energy costs. Improving insulation and upgrading heating systems directly lowers cost and reduces exposure to future price shocks, particularly where inefficient housing imposes the largest cost penalties.\n\n3.  Income matters for affordability, but place matters for exposure. Relying solely on national income thresholds risks overlooking households who face structurally high energy costs because of where and how they live. Given spatial heterogeneity, more granular, place-sensitive approaches may be needed to ensure support reaches those most exposed.\n\nAs energy prices settle at a higher level, the challenge for policymakers is no longer how to smooth volatility, but how to prevent nationally regulated prices from becoming a permanent source of inequality, working towards an energy system that is both efficient and equitable.\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Technical Appendix\n\n### 1. Study Objective\n\nThis study examines the structural drivers of domestic energy costs (electricity and gas) at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level in England. First, it identifies how housing characteristics, household composition, and heating systems are associated with variation in average annual household energy costs. Second, it assesses whether these relationships exhibit spatial dependence, indicating that some areas are systematically exposed to higher energy costs even after observable characteristics are controlled for.\n\nThe analysis is descriptive and explanatory rather than causal. By focusing on small-area averages, it highlights how nationally regulated energy prices translate into uneven local cost pressures through differences in housing stock, energy efficiency and household structure. The emphasis is on identifying structural sources of exposure and inequity, rather than estimating behavioural responses or causal treatment effects.\n\n### 2. Data and Assumptions\n\n#### 2.1 Spatial unit analysis and data sources\n\nThe analysis is conducted at MSOA level for England. MSOAs offer a balance between spatial resolution and data stability, avoiding the volatility associated with smaller geographies while preserving meaningful spatial variation.\n\n[Table 1]{.underline} summarizes variables considered and retained in the preferred specification.\n\n| Variable | Source | Methodology & assumptions |\n|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Annual electricity consumption (kWh) | DESNZ | MSOA mean domestic electricity consumption per meter (2023) |\n| Annual gas consumption (kWh) | DESNZ | MSOA mean domestic gas consumption per meter (2023) |\n| Electricity & gas prices | Ofgem | National average price cap values (incl. VAT), Jan–Mar 2024 |\n| Annual energy cost (dependent variable) | Author | Electricity + gas consumption × unit prices + standing charges |\n| Share of pre-1945 housing | VOA | Proxy for legacy housing inefficiency |\n| Share of EPC D–G dwellings | EPC Register | Proxy for poor energy efficiency (2019–2025) |\n| Median floor area (log) | EPC Register | Logged to address skewness |\n| Median household income (log) | ONS | Logged MSOA income (2023) |\n| Share of detached dwellings | Census 2021 | Captures structural heat loss |\n| Share of households with 4+ occupants | Census 2021 | Captures household size |\n| Heating type shares | Census 2021 | Electric-only, solid/liquid fuels, renewable networks |\n| Urban–rural indicator | ONS | Binary classification |\n| Region | ONS | Region fixed effects |\n\nWe assume that energy prices are nationally regulated and spatially uniform, reflecting Ofgem price caps. Spatial variation in observed energy costs therefore arises from differences in consumption, housing efficiency and heating systems rather than local price-setting.\n\n#### 2.2 Exploratory analysis of data variables\n\nExploratory analysis ([Figure A1]{.underline}) highlights substantial right-skewness in electricity consumption and total energy costs, driven by a subset of MSOAs with high electricity reliance and larger dwellings. As household income is also right-skewed, log-transformation is applied to stabilise variance.\n\nHeating system variables are unevenly distributed across space but are retained, as they represent structurally distinct energy systems with implications for electricity demand and exposure to high prices.\n\n::: {#d54d5543 .cell execution_count=27}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Energy_Cost_files/figure-html/cell-28-output-1.png){width=790 height=558}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExploratory plots of the dependent variable against key predictors ([Figure A2]{.underline}) subsequently inform variable selection and specification.\n\n::: {#8682ca82 .cell execution_count=28}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Energy_Cost_files/figure-html/cell-29-output-1.png){width=765 height=466}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 3. Methodology and Model Specification\n\n#### 3.1 Construction of energy costs\n\nAnnual household energy costs are constructed by combining MSOA-level average electricity and gas consumption with national unit prices and standing charges. Electricity and gas costs are calculated separately and summed to obtain total average annual energy cost per household.\n\n#### 3.2 Regression framework\n\nOrdinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is used as the primary modelling framework, due to its transparency and interpretability. Coefficients are interpreted as marginal associations with average annual household energy costs. All models are estimated with heteroscedasticity-robust (HC1) standard errors.\n\nThe preferred specification is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{EnergyCost}_i\n= {} & \\alpha\n+ \\beta_1 \\,\\text{Pre1945}_i\n+ \\beta_2 \\,\\text{EPC}_{D\\text{--}G,i}\n+ \\beta_3 \\log(\\text{FloorArea}_i) \\\\\n& + \\beta_4 \\log(\\text{Income}_i)\n+ \\beta_5 \\,\\text{Detached}_i\n+ \\beta_6 \\,\\text{HH}_{4+,i} \\\\\n& + \\beta_7 \\,\\text{FuelMix}_i\n+ \\beta_8 \\,\\text{Urban}_i\n+ \\gamma_r\n+ \\varepsilon_i\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere *i* indexes MSOAs and γᵣ denotes region fixed effects.\n\nVariables capture four structural dimensions:\n\n1.  **Housing age and efficiency** (share pre-1945, share EPC D–G)\n\n2.  **Housing scale and form** (log floor area, share detached)\n\n3.  **Household composition and income** (log income, share 4+ households)\n\n4.  **Heating infrastructure** (fuel mix indicators)\n\nMulticollinearity is assessed using variance inflation factors and remains within accepted thresholds.\n\n### 4. Regression Findings\n\nAcross all specifications, **structural housing characteristics and household composition** emerge as the primary drivers of variation in annual household energy costs.\n\n-   A higher share of **energy-inefficient dwellings (EPC D–G)** and **pre-1945 housing** is consistently associated with higher energy costs, even after controlling for income and dwelling size. These effects remain stable across all model specifications, indicating that housing efficiency and age exert an independent influence on energy expenditure.\n\n-   **Dwelling size and housing type** are also strongly associated with energy costs. Larger median floor areas and a higher share of detached housing are linked to higher expenditure, reflecting greater baseline energy demand.\n\n-   **Household composition plays a particularly important role.** MSOAs with a higher share of households containing four or more occupants exhibit substantially higher energy costs across all models, with this variable showing the largest coefficients throughout.\n\n-   The inclusion of **fuel mix variables** materially improves explanatory power, with the adjusted $R^2$ increasing from $0.572$to$0.713$. Electric-only heating is associated with significantly higher energy costs, while solid and liquid fuels and networked renewables are associated with lower average expenditure.\n\n-   The **urban–rural indicator** becomes substantively weak once housing and fuel characteristics are included, suggesting that observed urban–rural differences primarily reflect housing stock composition rather than settlement type.\n\n-   Adding **region fixed effects** further improves model fit (final adjusted $R^2$ = $0.745$), likely capturing residual climatic variation and regional housing patterns, without materially altering the main coefficient estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#ebc12662 .cell execution_count=33}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

This suggests that the main findings are robust, while acknowledging that exposure to high energy costs is partially shaped by spatially clustered, unobserved characteristics rather than misspecification of the core structural relationships.\n\nGeographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was further used to **explore spatial heterogeneity in coefficients**, focusing on income and EPC D–G share. An adaptive bandwidth is selected via AICc.\n\n::: {#149bc304 .cell results='asis' execution_count=40}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=40}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Variable</th>\n      <th>Mean coefficient</th>\n      <th>Std. dev.</th>\n      <th>Min</th>\n      <th>Median</th>\n      <th>Max</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Intercept</td>\n      <td>2207.98</td>\n      <td>220.54</td>\n      <td>750.35</td>\n      <td>2207.98</td>\n      <td>4028.94</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Share pre-1945 homes</td>\n      <td>25.62</td>\n      <td>29.36</td>\n      <td>-112.75</td>\n      <td>25.62</td>\n      <td>145.98</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Share EPC D–G homes</td>\n      <td>41.45</td>\n      <td>49.02</td>\n      <td>-86.38</td>\n      <td>41.45</td>\n      <td>247.65</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Log median floor area</td>\n      <td>55.84</td>\n      <td>55.33</td>\n      <td>-89.08</td>\n      <td>55.84</td>\n      <td>300.52</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Log income</td>\n      <td>89.19</td>\n      <td>51.33</td>\n      <td>-132.50</td>\n      <td>89.19</td>\n      <td>368.16</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>Share detached homes</td>\n      <td>148.40</td>\n      <td>192.09</td>\n      <td>-973.50</td>\n      <td>148.40</td>\n      <td>1634.11</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>Share households ≥4 persons</td>\n      <td>69.08</td>\n      <td>45.90</td>\n      <td>-123.66</td>\n      <td>69.08</td>\n      <td>229.57</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nResults show some spatial variation:\n\n-   In some areas, income is strongly associated with higher energy costs, reflecting consumption-driven demand.\n\n-   In others, the EPC D–G coefficient dominates, indicating that poor housing efficiency imposes high costs regardless of income.\n\nGWR substantially improves model fit ($R^2 = 0.88$), but is interpreted as exploratory, highlighting where mechanisms differ rather than replacing global estimates. The high $R^2$ reflects local overfitting inherent to GWR and should not be interpreted as superior explanatory power relative to the global model.\n\n### 6. Reflections and Limitations\n\nThis analysis is subject to several limitations. As an ecological study, it cannot capture within-area household heterogeneity or behavioural responses such as under-heating. Prices are assumed spatially uniform, and retrofit history is not directly observed.\n\nResidual spatial clustering reflects genuine structural heterogeneity rather than model failure. From an equity perspective, the results underline that exposure to high energy costs is shaped by place-specific housing conditions, not income alone. This reinforces the need for policy approaches that integrate housing efficiency and local context alongside income-based support.\n\n## References\n\n\n\n\n\n",
